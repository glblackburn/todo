# About the project

You are putting together a new startup to disrupt the lucrative
billion-dollar market of Todo applications. In order to raise VC
funding, you have to come up with a proof-of-concept app in order to
dazzle the investors.

## Features

* add a todo item
* delete a todo item
* view all todo items

# Getting Started

## Setup Notes

This application runs using node.js.  The node and npx commands need
to be available in the PATH. Use the "make run" command to start the
application.

I use nvm to manage the version of node.js being used, but there is no
requirement to use nvm.  As long as the node and npx commands are
available in the path, the "make run" target will execute the
application.

## Install Notes

### Install nvm
* run "make install-nvm"
* https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

### Install node.js
* run "make install-node"
* https://nodejs.org/

## Markdown Preview Plus
Having a local way to view Markdown is very helpful.  The [Markdown
Preview
Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl)
chrome plugin does a pretty good job and make is a lot easier to
revise markdown code before pushing to GitHub.  I found a thread
referencing the plugin on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9843609/view-markdown-files-offline).
After installing the plugin, you need to enable "Allow access to file URLs" in Extensions (menu > More tools > Extensions or enter URL chrome://extensions/ instead).

## Markdown Cheatsheet
I always seem to land on this [Markdown
Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
when looking for a reference, so I added a reference.
